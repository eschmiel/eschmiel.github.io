## What is Combat Tracker Lite?

Combat Tracker Lite is a lightweight tool for running combat encounters in Dungeons and Dragons. It is primarily concerned with helping the Dungeon Master keep track of turn order and basic character information.

## Why build Combat Tracker Lite?

When I first started running Dungeons and Dragons games, I found it difficult to keep track of turn order in combat. The primary issue was that the order you recorded players’ initiative rolls in wasn’t the same order players actually went in. While it is tedious to rewrite the list of all of the combatants on paper once you have the turn order figured out, this seemed like a problem that could easily be solved with automation.

[Insert explanatory diagram]

Most of the combat tracker tools I had previously found online had unintuitive interfaces, were bloated with features and required setting up accounts. I wanted a combat tracker tool that I could effortlessly pull up in a web browser on a whim and start using immediately. So I decided to build my own, hence, Combat Tracker Lite.

### Features Include:

- Combatants are automatically sorted in order of highest initiative, including groups.
- Dead combatant names are crossed out when hp is 0
- Buttons light up on mouse over.
- Sub-entries use the group’s initial HP and AC as defaults.
