## 4 Global Game Jams, 3 Ludum Dares and 1 Emotional Mecha Jam

>I am a web developer based in Richmond, Virginia with strong roots in my local game development community. I originally got the hands-on experience I needed to build my programming proficiency through game development and the influence of that foundation is clear in my web work. My technical focus is React and Node.js.
><br/><br>
>My most recent personal projects include: 
><br/>
>1) A web app for live streamers to help them manage their going-live notifications on Twitter. <br/>
>2) A dynamically sorting table to help game masters run combat encounters in Dungeons and Dragons through a convenient, desktop browser-based web app.
