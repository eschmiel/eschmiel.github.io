## 4 Global Game Jams, 3 Ludum Dares and 1 Emotional Mecha Jam

I am a web developer based in Richmond, Virginia with strong roots in my local game development community. I originally got the hands-on experience I needed to build my programming proficiency in game development and the influence of that foundation is clear in my web work. My current focus for my personal work is developing small tools for digital creatives and their communities to help them manage their social media presences. Professionally, my goal is to find work getting hands-on experience developing and designing large scale, maitainable systems for business applications.
