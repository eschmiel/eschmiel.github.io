## 4 Global Game Jams, 3 Ludum Dares and 1 Emotional Mecha Jam

>I am a web developer based in Richmond, Virginia with strong roots in my local game development community. I originally got the hands-on experience I needed to build my programming proficiency through game development and the influence of that foundation is clear in my web work. My personal work is currently focused on developing small tools for digital creatives and their communities that will help them manage their social media presences.
